## Testing

### Testing planning

Mainly following tests were planned

1. I need to launch the website in a browser to look for any layout or visual problems.
2. By engaging with various components, including links, buttons, forms, and navigation menus, I need to evaluate the website's functionality.
3. I need to check   all the user stories to confirm whether they are satisfied.
4. I want to test the website's performance by adjusting the size of the browser window and simulating various devices.
5. I need to check the website's cross-browser compatibility by opening it in several different browsers.
6. I want to check the HTML and CSS code for syntax issues or other warnings.
7. By completing forms and submitting data from different circumstances, I need to test forms and user input.
8. I need to double-check both the internal and external links to make sure they work properly.
9. By examining server response times and loading times of pages, I want to assess the website's performance.
10. By determining if the website complies with accessibility standards, I want to evaluate the website's usability.

I need to do all of these actions to guarantee that the website looks good, works properly, and offers a satisfying user experience throughout devices and browsers.

### Implementation

I carefully followed the pre-planned procedures when testing my web page to ensure a complete assessment. Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Edge are the four widely used browsers I selected to test the website at the beginning. Using a thorough methodology, I was able to evaluate cross-browser compatibility and spot any discrepancies or problems that might exist across various platforms.

I made use of the Google Chrome developer tools to assess the website's performance. To imitate desktop and tablet viewpoints, I tested for a range of screen sizes, starting with the smallest and working my way up to the largest. This allowed me to verify that the website offered an seamless user interface and adjusted correctly to various screen sizes.

I used the element.style box in the Chrome tools' style section a lot while testing. Before adding my styling to the actual code, this functionality let me evaluate and confirm it. I could play with various categories and find any mistakes or missing parts by making changes to the actual document (editing in HTML). I carefully copied the correct code and smoothly implemented it into my codebase when the necessary change was confirmed.

I also evaluated the website's performance and accessibility using Google Lighthouse. This tool offered perceptions into potential development areas. I concentrated on reducing image sizes in order to improve performance. I tried to reduce the size of the files without sacrificing visual quality by scaling down the photographs and properly compressing them. The website became quicker and more responsive as a result of this optimisation.

I gave careful consideration to the contrast ratio of the font colours selected on the page in purposes of easy access. I made sure that the contrast among the text and its background was sufficient to satisfy accessibility standards so that individuals with visual disabilities could easily read it. I tried to make the material easily readable for everyone who looked at it by choosing acceptable colour schemes and modifying the formatting as necessary.

I added visually masked texts to improve accessibility even further. I took measures to make sure that crucial details, including labels for form inputs, were seen by screen readers by employing methods like visibly hidden CSS classes or the aria-label attribute. For visually challenged viewers, these hidden texts offered additional context, ensuring that they could engage with and comprehend the content efficiently.

To ensure code quality and compliance with standards, I frequently used the Jigsaw and W3C validators. These tools helped me identify any syntax errors, structural issues, or non-compliant elements in my HTML and CSS code. By rectifying these concerns promptly, I maintained a high level of code integrity.

I carefully checked the operation of all four browsers' buttons, links, forms, and other interactive features during the testing process. This all-encompassing strategy made sure that all website functions were completely functional and offered a smooth user experience independent of the selected browser.

I made sure that my website complied with the highest requirements for functionality, usability, and satisfaction among users by sticking to this comprehensive testing technique, which covered browser compatibility, responsiveness, code validation, accessibility, and performance optimisation.

- [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) used for CSS validation

## Deployment

The project was done using Codeanywhere with VS Code. Github used for version control and used as the code hosting platform.
Commits are done regulary and using terminal as well as inbuilt source control tab in VS code.

Github pages were used to deploy the site. Selected the master Branch from the source section drop-down menu by navigating settings tab in the GitHub repository.Detailed ribbon was appeared and page was automatically refreshed with successful deployment.

## Bugs

I found several bugs while I was developing the website. Here How i identify and dubug the each bug.

1. As per my design I wanted to set Nav bar center of header for desktop and tablet views.  However when comes to mobile devices it is more user friendly to set  toggler button  on right top corner. Therefore I had to use nav bar bootstrap class in 2 different div elements(debug). It took considerable time to make the toggler button work properly.
2. In my design i wanted to set my web page takeplace whole view port area for desktop view without any scrolling. For acheive the purpose I had to change the footer position fixed and relative different device widths and heights. In  that case I found footer icon intersect with page content when its come to tablet view and cant see the bottom part of the page content due to this bug. Debugging was done considering breakponits(768px, 992px) as well as considering height of each type of devices. I had to use CSS nested media qurries to debug.
3. I found some poor contrast ratio when I was using lighthouse tool for testing accessibilty. Since I decided to use  a matching color pallet for each page. since I could not change the basic theme i did change small color changes using a color contrast analyzer by changing the lightness of font colors according to color contrast guildline.  I frequently used google developer tool to see the changes before coding.
4. When it comes to tablet view I found a bug in nav bar about me word appear in 2 lines and it increse the height of nav bar and other texts in navbar looks asymmetric since text are not vertically align. Also it is not look visually appealing. I had to reduce the horizontal padding of related button class to debug this.I tried several method but this is the less coding method.

All above bugs are found at final stage of developing. However more than 30 bugs were identified and debug while developing the website. Chrome developer tool played a major part for debugging and had use CSS media qurries widely to debug.
